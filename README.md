# Delhivery - Feature Engineering

# About Delhivery

Delhivery is the largest and fastest-growing fully integrated player in India by revenue in Fiscal 2021. They aim to build the operating system for commerce, through a combination of world-class infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.

The Data team builds intelligence and capabilities using this data that helps them to widen the gap between the quality, efficiency, and profitability of their business versus their competitors.

# How can you help here?

The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering pipelines:

• Clean, sanitize and manipulate data to get useful features out of raw fields

• Make sense out of the raw data and help the data science team to build forecasting models on it

# Dataset

Dataset Link: delhivery_data.csv

# Steps to download the dataset:

Open the dataset link, which will launch a new browser window displaying the raw data.
In the newly opened window, right-click on any empty space without selecting any text, then choose "Save As."
A window will appear, prompting you to select the destination folder where you want to save the dataset.
Choose the desired location, provide a suitable name for the dataset, and ensure to include the ".csv" extension. Finally, click on the "Save" button.

# Column Profiling:

data - tells whether the data is testing or training data
trip_creation_time – Timestamp of trip creation
route_schedule_uuid – Unique Id for a particular route schedule
route_type – Transportation type
FTL – Full Truck Load: FTL shipments get to the destination sooner, as the truck is making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way
Carting: Handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)
trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and destination centers)
source_center - Source ID of trip origin
source_name - Source Name of trip origin
destination_cente – Destination ID
